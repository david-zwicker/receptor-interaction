* Classes that are implemented:
    - single blocks
    - given list of blocks (this is just a list of instances of the previous class)
    - all possible blocks of certain kind (same length, possible colors, etc.)
    - all possible collections of a fixed number of blocks
    - interaction between two blocks (this is a special case of the next class)
    - interaction between two sets of blocks
    - interaction between a list of substrate and all possible receptors
 * Things to implement
    - 2D carpets as a generalization of chains
    - other experiments (detecting a mixture of substrates)
